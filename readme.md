# Zillow Regression Project: Predicting Tax Value
<br>

## Project Description
 - This purpose of this project is to create a Regression model that predicts that tax value of single unit properties purchased between  May 1st, 2017 and August 31st, 2017
 - Project created using the data science pipeline (Acquisition, Preparation, Exploration, Analysis & Statistical Testing, and finally Modeling and Evaluation)

## Project Goals
 - Create a Final Jupyter Notebook that reads like a report and follows the data science pipeline
 - In the Jupyter Notebook Create a regression model that performs bettern than our baseline mean RMSE and R-squared scores
 - Create Function Files to help peers execute project reproduction
 - Google Slide Deck that presents findings to the Zillow data science team

## Deliverables
 - Final Jupyter Notebook
 - Function Files for reproduction
 - Trello Board (Agenda Board)
 - Detailed Readme
 - Slide Deck with Findings

## Executive Summary
 - Predict tax value of Single Unit Properties purchased between May 1st, 2017 and August 31st, 2017 using Regression Models 
 - Target variable: tax_value of properties
 - Best features determined: baths, beds, square_feet
 - Polynomial Regression with 3 degrees performed the best by a close margin. 
 - R^2 value of 0.3557
 - RMSE: 250169.84

## Hypothesis
 - Square Footage will most likely be the biggest factor in determining price within the dataset
 - Bathroom count and Bedroom Count will also most likely have a high positive correlation in relation to price
